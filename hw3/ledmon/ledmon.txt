
This is a simple user-land tool for watching the LEDs on an Intel
e1000/e1000e based NIC.  Simply compile with "make" and run as root.
(As always, when someone says to run as root, please be sure to inspect
the code so you are sure that there are no security issues lurking)

NAME
	ledmon - watch LEDs on an Intel e1000/e1000e NIC

SYNOPSIS
	ledmon -s <pci-addr> [-L] [-v] [ethportname]

DESCRIPTION
	Print the current state of the four LEDs on an Intel e1000/e1000e
	based NIC, as specified by <bus:slot.func> on the command line.

	-L	run in a continuous loop
	-v	print the version and exit

EXAMPLE
	ledmon -s 00:08
		Show the current state of the ens3 LEDs

	ledmon -s 00:08 -L
		Show the LED states over and over, looping several times
		per second, so the changes can be seen.

	ledmon -s 00:08 -L eth0
		Show the LED states over and over, looping several times
		per second, so the changes can be seen.  Also use the
		network interface (eth0) to determine link speed.  This
		option is only valid when the e1000/e1000e driver is still
		loaded.

	ledmon -v
		Show the current version of the program.

NOTES
	This is not useful for any other NIC.

	This must be run as root.

	If the ethportname is not specified, the current speed and link
	information cannot be used in figuring out what LEDs are lighted,
	thus perhaps not quite matching reality.  If the ethport driver
	has been unloaded, there is no speed or link, so they won't be a
	factor in setting the LED states.  Either one of these cases will
	result in this program showing LEDs as off when LEDCTL is in a
	default configuration.
